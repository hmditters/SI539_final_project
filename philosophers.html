          <h1>Anaximander</h1>
          <p>The early Greek philosophers saw the world around them and asked questions about it. Instead of attributing its creation to anthropomorphic gods, they sought rational explanations. One idea the Pre-Socratic philosophers had was that there was a single underlying substance that held within itself principles of change. This underlying substance and its inherent principles could become anything. In addition to looking at the building blocks of matter, the early philosophers looked at the stars, music, and number systems. Later philosophers focused entirely on conduct or ethics. Instead of asking what made the world, they asked what was the best way to live.</p>

          <h1>Anaximenes</h1>
          <p>Anaximenes (d. c. 528 B.C.) was a Pre-Socratic philosopher. Anaximenes, together with Anaximander and Thales, formed what we call the Milesian School.</p>

          <p>Empedocles of Acragas (c. 495-435 B.C.) was known as a poet, statesman, and physician, as well as a philosopher. Empedocles encouraged people to look upon him as a miracle worker. Philosophically he believed in the four elements.</p>

          <h1>Heraclitus</h1>
          <p>Heraclitus (fl. 69th Olympiad, 504-501 B.C.) is the first philosopher known to use the word kosmos for world order, which he says ever was and ever will be, not created by god or man. Heraclitus is thought to have abdicated the throne of Ephesus in favor of his brother. He was known as Weeping Philosopher and Heraclitus the Obscure.</p>

          <h1>Parmenides</h1>
          <p>Parmenides (b c. 510 B.C.) was a Greek philosopher. He argued against the existence of a void, a theory used by later philosophers in the expression "nature abhors a vacuum," which stimulated experiments to disprove it. Parmenides argued that change and motion are only delusions.</p>

          <h1>Zeno of Elea</h1>
          <p>The depictions of the two Zenos are similar; both were tall. This portion of Raphael's The School of Athens shows one of the two Zenos, but not necessarily the Eleatic.
          Zeno is the greatest figure of the Eleatic School.
          Diogenes Laertes says that Zeno was a native of Elea (Velia), the son of Telentagoras and pupil of Parmenides. He says Aristotle called him the inventor of dialectics, and the writer of many books. Zeno was politically active in trying to get rid of a tyrant of Elea, whom he managed to take aside -- and bite, possibly taking off his nose.</p>

          <h1>Socrates</h1>
          <p>Socrates was one of the most famous Greek philosophers, whose teaching Plato reported in his dialogues.
          Socrates (c. 470–399 B.C.), who was also a soldier during the Peloponnesian War and a stonemason after, was renowned as a philosopher and educator. In the end, he was accused of corrupting Athens' youth and for impiety, for which reasons he was executed in the Greek manner -- by drinking poisonous hemlock.</p>

          <h1>Plato</h1>
          <p>Plato (428/7 - 347 B.C.) was one of the most famous philosophers of all time. A type of love (Platonic) is named for him. We know about the famous philosopher Socrates through Plato's dialogues. Plato is known as the father of idealism in philosophy. His ideas were elitist, with the philosopher king the ideal ruler. Plato is perhaps best known to college students for his parable of a cave, which appears in Plato's Republic.</p>

          <h1>Aristotle</h1>
          <p>Aristotle was born in the city of Stagira in Macedonia. His father, Nichomacus, was the personal physician to King Amyntas of Macedonia.
          Aristotle (384 - 322 B.C.) was one of the most important western philosophers, a student of Plato and teacher of Alexander the Great. Aristotle's philosophy, logic, science, metaphysics, ethics, politics, and system of deductive reasoning have been of inestimable importance ever since. In the Middle Ages, the Church used Aristotle to explain its doctrines.</p>
